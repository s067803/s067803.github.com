Example: $x^{n}+y^{n} \neq z^{n}$ for $n \geq 3$  

\[ 
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n} 
\text{ is divergent, but } 
\lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{i} - \ln n \text{exists.}

\title{\LaTeX}

\begin{document}
\maketitle \LaTeX{} is a document preparation system for the \TeX{} 
typesetting program. It offers programmable desktop publishing 
features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of 
typesetting and desktop publishing, including numbering and 
cross-referencing, tables and figures, page layout, bibliographies, 
and much more. \LaTeX{} was originally written in 1984 by Leslie 
Lamport and has become the dominant method for using \TeX; few 
people write in plain \TeX{} anymore. The current version is 
\LaTeXe.

% This is a comment, it is not shown in the final output.
% The following shows a little of the typesetting power of LaTeX
\begin{eqnarray}
E &=& mc^2                              \\
m &=& \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\end{eqnarray}
